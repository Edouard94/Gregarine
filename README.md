# Study of Eugregarine infecting the cricket _Acheta domesticus_

This repository has been created to store diverse data linked to the study of eugregarines infecting Acheta domesticus.

The bioassay folder contains the datasets from two experiments: a density experiment and a 'mesh experiment'. The latter was made with a system allowing gregarine-free crickets and a complete control of the infection.

There are as well images and videos showing the life cycle of gregarines infecting _A. domesticus_ and different techniques linked to its isolation and production. Videos can be played on VLC media player for example (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).
